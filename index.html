                Meet Mitchell Frey, an amateur coder with aspirations of becoming a professional programmer. His interest in programming began with his work in video and audio editing, which introduced him to many concepts utilized in the development of code. After encouragement by his friends and family, he decided to pursue this interest in coding by taking an online Coding Bootcamp offered by Michigan State University through Trilogy Education. He is also a professional musician with a Masters in Music from Indiana University, though due to the COVID-19 pandemic cancelling most music events (and thus halting his music career), he decided to pursue his other interest of programming.
